# Robogarage-Robot-Uprising-Software
This project implements a robotic capture-the-flag ball game in a defined arena. Robots are tracked and identified using ArUco markers, and the arena boundaries are dynamically defined from ArUco marker positions. The system enables robots to autonomously play against each other, detect game elements, and navigate the arena using computer vision.
